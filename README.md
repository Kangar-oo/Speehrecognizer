Speech Recognition with Python
==============================

This Python script captures audio from your microphone and converts it into text using the Google Web Speech API.

Features
--------
- Captures audio input from the microphone
- Uses Google's speech recognition engine to transcribe audio
- Handles errors like unknown speech and API issues
- Prepares for ambient noise for better accuracy

Requirements
------------
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

    pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio

Note: `pyaudio` may require additional setup depending on your OS.
On Windows, use:

    pip install pipwin
    pipwin install pyaudio

How to Use
----------
1. Run the script:

    python your_script_name.py

2. Speak clearly into the microphone after the "Listening..." prompt.
3. The script will print what it hears using Google's Speech-to-Text.

How It Works
------------
- Initializes a speech recognizer.
- Adjusts for background noise.
- Listens for your voice through the microphone.
- Sends the audio to Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition service.
- Prints out the recognized speech.

Error Handling
--------------
- If the speech is unclear, you'll get:
  "Sorry, I couldn't understand what you said."

- If the API request fails (e.g., no internet), you'll see:
  "Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service"

Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
------------------------------------
- Add text-to-speech output using `pyttsx3`
- Save recognized text to a file
- Integrate with voice commands or virtual assistants
